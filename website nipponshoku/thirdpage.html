<h2 class="first">fit lifestyle through constant excersise</h2>
<p class="para1">The secret behind Japan's successful life expectancy rate is not just their diet plans and food habits but their active lifestyle as well. The Japanese include a lot of physical exercise in their daily lifestyles. Japan is a small country and thus there is not enough space for everyone to use a car hence, the Japanese government invested in really advanced public transportation. This results in people walking a lot to their homes and workplaces. Statistics show that around 98% of Japanese children walk or cycle to school. Not only the young generation but also the elderly walk and cycle as part of their daily routine. </p>

<h2 class="second">Good Healthcare system</h2>
<p class="para2">Japanese health care systems are really advanced and in order. Japan’s health care system is one of the best in the world, it was ranked fourth by Bloomberg Efficient Health Care. Since the 1960s, the government has paid 70 per cent of all health procedures and up to 90 per cent for low-income citizens. They also have developed medical knowledge and advanced technology making their healthcare systems even better. Japanese citizens visit the doctor an average of 13 times a year for checkups. This means that illnesses are more likely to be caught early or in their developing stages which makes it easier to overcome. Not only that but Local government authorities provide mass screening for everyone at school, at work or in the community. It is also mandatory for everyone to fill in a medical questionnaire about health and lifestyle. These annual check-ups help people become more health conscious.</p>

<h2 class="third">more on eat habbits</h2>
<p class="para3">“hara hachi bun me” is a saying in Japanese which explains that you should consume food only until you are 80 percent full. Studies show that the more you eat, the more inflammatory stress is imposed on your body. It usually takes a minimum of 20 minutes for the brain to realize you’re full, so Japanese people use ‘hara hachi bun me’ as a reminder to stop eating. Smaller portions and slower eating habits are also followed by the Japanese to stay healthy and achieve a long lifespan. During their meal time they serve the food on smaller plates and sit on the floor along with using chopsticks. This makes eating slower and relaxed which helps your stomach to digest the food properly. It is not just about what you eat but is about how you eat too. </p>
